The Elyra code of conduct is derived from [The Ruby Community Conduct Guideline](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/conduct/)

The scope of this Code of Conduct's enforcement is limited to Github and any future official development spaces.

* Participants will be tolerant of opposing views.
* Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
* When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.
* Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.

Evidence of private harassment is grounds to be blocked on Github and any future official development spaces, regardless of if said harassment occurred on these official spaces.
If you need to report an issue, you can contact me with relevant information.
